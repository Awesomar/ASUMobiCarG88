# ASUMobiCarG88
It is a smart RC car project, with some features like "easy driving with obstacles avoidance, accurate movement and line tracking".

## Basic System Components
- Car mechanics kit. <br />
- Arduino kit. <br />
- Battery. <br />
- Bluetooth communication module. <br />
- Sensors. <br />
- Bluetooth Terminal Software in Mobile. <br />

## Easy Driving Application
- User should press a button on car or submit special Bluetooth command to put the car in easy driving mode. <br />
- User can control car movement using mobile. <br />
- User can move the car forward, backward, left and right. <br />
- The car should avoid obstacles. <br />
*The minimum requirements of obstacle avoidance is stop to avoid collision.* <br />

## Line Tracking Application
- Students should prepare set of connected white sheets (2m x 2m) and draw track over it. <br />
- User should press a button on car or submit special Bluetooth command to put the car in line tracking mode. <br />
- When the car placed over the track it should follow the line. <br />
*The minimum requirements is to use simple closed track.* <br />

## Accurate Movement Application
- User should press a button on car or submit special Bluetooth command to put the car in accurate movement mode. <br />
- Use can order the car to move forward or backward for certain length (EX 40 cm). <br />
- Use can order the car to move right with proper angle (EX 30 degree). <br />
- While demo the car should move in infinity shape then rectangle shape then circle shape. <br />
- The car should return to beginning point after finishing each shape. <br />
- The car should stop for 25 seconds after finishing each shape. <br />
- The shape size must be (2m x 2m) no more no less. <br />
